    <h2>Product manager</h2>
    <h3>Professional summary</h3>
    I've been in the product management game for 3 years, focusing on upping conversion rates, driving revenue, slashing costs, keeping customers happy and coming back for more, and pushing up that net promoter score along with customer satisfaction. I'm all about building strong relationships with customers and coworkers, and providing top-notch user experience. Plus, I'm always down to roll up my sleeves and do whatever it takes to deliver real value to our users.
